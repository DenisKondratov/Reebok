            <h3>Top soes</h3>
            <p>
                Co-designed with U.S. weightlifting phenom and Rogue athlete CJ Cummings, this White /
                Black / Rubber Gum version of the Reebok Legacy Lifter is precision-engineered to the needs of athletes
                at
                the highest levels of competition. The advanced design combines quality construction and a firm
                foundation
                with a level of comfort, breathability, and style rarely found in a competition-ready weightlifting
                shoe.
                The Legacy Lifter features a high and wide, 22MM thick drop-heel and extra-hard TPU clip for maximum
                stability on the heaviest lifts. Overlapping straps create a full, lockdown foot wrap, while the shoe’s
                breathable upper, cushioned midsole, and anatomical sockliner offer ample support for producing maximum
                power.
